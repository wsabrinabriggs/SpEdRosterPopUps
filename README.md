Hello there, and thanks for taking the time to read my code!

This is a roster, using the names of Black artists, inventors, educators, and other public figueres, to represent fictional students with IEPs (Individualized Education Programs or Plans).
It holds special education related information to help with compliance, particulary dates of important documents.
The spreadsheet displays pop-up messages about the type and number of IEPs due and their general timeframe. 
The messages pop up whenever the spreadsheet is opened, refreshed, and when activated from the custom menu. 
There are 3 types of IEPs: initial, reevaluation (reeval), and annual, and due dates vary. 
To support the tracking of due dates, color coding is used. 
Red rows means overdue and orange or pink rows, that means the reeval or annual IEP is in 30 calendar days or 14 calendars, respectfully
